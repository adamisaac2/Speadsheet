# Comments to Evaluators
Not much to say regarding this assignment. I spent a fair amount of time on source code and found that I finished all of it after around
10 hours or so. I found that the tests given to us were OK for alot of big cases and that I only really needed to ensure a few methods worked
that werent covered by the tests given to us. I made a few extra test cases just to get my code coverage up and I am at 96 percent so hopefully
that should be good enough for the grading tests.
