# Overview of the Spreadsheet functionality

The Spreadsheet program is currently capable of not very much. I definitely underestimated
how easy this was going to be. Its extremely buggy at the moment and can only do a certain amount
of features. It is especially buggy when it contains complex expressions using parenthesis and when 
variables and parenthesis are used in the same expression.Future extensions are bug fixing and 
getting variables to correctly work with parenthesis.

    Time Breakdown Assignment 1 - 
    My first day working on this, I spent about 4 or 5 hours just writing all the base code without debugging
    to kind of work my way and get a feel for how I thought the code would best work. The next day I spent about 4
    hours getting the tests set up and debugging the testing software which was kind of a pain. I then spent
    about 5 more hours finishing up the code and started debugging. I thought my base code was gonna be pretty good
    but I was completely wrong. It was a complete buggy mess that didnt really work half the time so I spent about 
    10 hours through 2 more days debugging and writing new code, and fixing that code. In total I spent about 
    20 hours on the source code and probably 5 on the tester.

    Time Breakdown Assignment 2 - 
    Not alot to say about the time spent on this assignment. I probably spent around 10 hours total, most of it on writing 
    the code and then probably 2 hours debugging and getting the tests to work. I would say that the tests provided to us 
    were adequate at testing the big cases while I only needed to really look into a small number of problems regarding other methods. 
    I then made a few extra test cases in the Tester class to ensure my code coverage was as much as I could possibly get.
