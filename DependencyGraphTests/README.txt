# Comments to Evaluators
Not much to say involving the tester class. I used the tests given to us as a baseline for my source code and once I got all those tests 
to work and run without errors, I wrote a few extra tests to kind of not only familiarize myself better with the testing software but 
to ensure my source code had as much coverage as possible. I am currently at 96 percent so hopefully that will be enough for the grading
tests.
