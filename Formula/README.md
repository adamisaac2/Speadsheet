# Comments to Evaluators
uhhh, I had spent alot more time that I had anticipated on this because at the start when I first implemented the formula method
I had messed up on the way the tokens were added to the list and I couldnt figure out what was going wrong for the longest time 
After I did figure out what was going wrong and fixed it, I was basically finished except for a few exceptions on handling operators 
that I didnt fix the first time I worked on assignment 1.
