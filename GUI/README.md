# Comments to Evaluators
Time Estimate : 20 Hours Actual Hours : ~20

So far(end of day 5) I have spent probably close to 15 hours working on the GUI. I would say alot of this time was spent learning
how the GUI coding part works with MAUI and C#. I have run into alot of walls with the coding of this GUI and regret deeply not working
with a partner for the assignment. I do not think I am going to get a good grade on this but what can you do, I already made the choice so
it is what it is. 

I would say my estimates are probably the same as they have always been. I always have been pretty close to estimating how much time
I would need depending on the project. But I also seem to not do well on them so maybe I should like guess they will take longer so I 
will do more on them and make them better. Idk.
