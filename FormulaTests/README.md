# Comments to Evaluators
Tester class was light work, didnt really take alot of time at all, just wrote alot of tests because I wanted to get as much code coverage
as possible. All tests passed off rip, or took a small amount of time to fix and get to pass. In total I made something like 30 tests but 
some of them were repetitive so I just deleted them.
