# Comments to Evaluators
Spreadsheet was an assignment that I think went well for me. I spent a pretty good amount of time throughout 2 days and I think that I 
am ready to submit it. I didnt really have too many problems, only just one significant one that caused the majority of the pain for this 
assignment, and it was only because of one line of code. The problem caused more time then I anticipated because I had thought that the problem
was inside of a different method then it was. Anyways, I think this assignment should be complete.
