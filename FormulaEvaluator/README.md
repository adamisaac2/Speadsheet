# Comments to Evaluators
Not really much to say, alot of time spent debugging and researching. I definitely underestimated the finer details
and how much trouble they were gonna cause me. Also debugging took like twice as long as it usually does for me. Overall
not a very fun first assignment. Doesnt even really properly work either. Pain.
