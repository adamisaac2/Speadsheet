# Comments to Evaluators
The test class went about the same as usual, spent some time after each important method was implemented to make some tests and see if that
method was working properly. If the test failed I would go back and fix it and rinse and repeat until all the methods were implemented. I have
I think 97 percent coverage, so that should be good enough for the autograder to give me a good grade. Overall I probably spent like 2 and a half
hours writing tests, I think I might be slow when it comes to that lol. 

# Comments To Evaluators - Update Assignment 5
Date - 2 - 18 - 2024 
I spent a decent amount of time trying to revise my tests, because we had to change the return type on some of the methods from sets to lists
and from public to protected which required me to do a little finessing so I could still get close to 100 percent coverage. I have something 
like 52 tests total, alot reused from the last assignment but also alot I made new. Overall I spent probably like 3 hours total time writing
tests and also revising the old ones.
