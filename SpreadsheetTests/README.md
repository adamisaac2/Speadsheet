# Comments to Evaluators
The test class went about the same as usual, spent some time after each important method was implemented to make some tests and see if that
method was working properly. If the test failed I would go back and fix it and rinse and repeat until all the methods were implemented. I have
I think 97 percent coverage, so that should be good enough for the autograder to give me a good grade. Overall I probably spent like 2 and a half
hours writing tests, I think I might be slow when it comes to that lol.
